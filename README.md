> An interactive **Change Making Problem** implementation using the **Greedy Algorithm**, built as an **ADA (Analysis and Design of Algorithms) project** for **Semester 5 Computer Engineering**.

This project demonstrates how the **greedy approach** is applied to solve the classic **change-making problem**, a fundamental topic in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

The **Change Maker Game** is a web-based academic project that calculates the **minimum number of coins or notes** required to make a given amount using the **Greedy Algorithm**.

Instead of limiting the learning to theory, this project:
- Implements the greedy algorithm in real code  
- Shows how algorithm logic works step by step  
- Makes ADA concepts easier to understand through UI  

This repository is useful for students searching for:
> *change making problem greedy algorithm*,  
> *ADA project for computer engineering*,  
> *greedy algorithm implementation*,  
> *DSA mini project*,  
> *algorithm visualization project*.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used – Greedy Algorithm

### 🔹 Change Making Problem
The **Change Making Problem** is a classic problem in **algorithm design**, where the goal is to make a target amount using the **minimum number of coins** from a given set of denominations.

### 🔹 Why Greedy Algorithm?
The greedy algorithm:
- Selects the **largest denomination first**
- Reduces the remaining amount iteratively
- Produces optimal results for standard currency systems

This project demonstrates:
- Greedy choice property  
- Optimal substructure  
- Time-efficient algorithm design  

These concepts are core topics in **ADA**, **DSA**, and **algorithm analysis**.
